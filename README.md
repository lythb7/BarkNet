# BarkNet
Code for a Convolutional Neural Network-Based device, implemented on a Raspberry Pi, that detects dog barks, sends text messages to a predefined number when a threshold of barks is detected, and activates an attached ultrasound module to deter the detected dog. The aim is to protect the user from stray dogs.
